    "#In Python, the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy are related to creating copies of objects or data structures. Here's the difference between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Shallow Copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#A shallow copy creates a new object or data structure but references the same elements as the original.\n",
    "#Changes made to the original object can affect the shallow copy, and vice versa.\n",
    "#In a shallow copy, the outer structure is copied, but the elements inside are referenced.\n",
    "#It creates a new object, but the internal references of the new object still point to the same objects as the original.\n",
    "#Shallow copy can be performed using the copy() method or the [:] slicing operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Deep Copy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#A deep copy creates a new object or data structure and recursively copies all the elements from the original to the new copy.\n",
    "#Changes made to the original object do not affect the deep copy, and vice versa.\n",
    "#In a deep copy, both the outer structure and the elements inside are copied recursively to new objects.\n",
    "#It creates a completely independent copy of the original object, including all nested objects or elements.\n",
    "#Deep copy can be performed using the deepcopy() function from the copy module.\n",
    "#To summarize, a shallow copy creates a new object that references the same elements as the original, \n",
    "#while a deep copy creates a new object with completely independent copies of all the elements."
